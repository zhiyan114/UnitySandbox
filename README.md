# UnitySandbox
A Sample Game that are used for me to explore the unity's game engine.

# How to build
Currently, checkpoint is the only way to obtain pre-build binaries. Even if it available, it would probably be out-of-date and only supports Windows platform. To build your own, you'll need to install unity.

Although you can use any versions/editions, it recommended that you use the following version of unity since those are the ones that are used to make this game.
* License Type: `Pro`
* Version: `2020.3.25f1 (LTS)`

If you're unable to build for any reason, feel free to use the WebGL pre-build version here: https://unitysandbox.furries.video/ (It is still recommended that you're playing this sample game on Desktop platforms and not any other platform for maximum compatibility)
